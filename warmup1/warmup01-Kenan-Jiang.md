Plush Coconut Cake
==================

Ingredients
-----------

-   *2* cups plus *3* tablespoons (*285* grams) all-purpose flour
-   *1 1/2* teaspoons baking soda
-   *1 1/2* teaspoon fine sea salt
-   *1* cup (*200* grams) granulated sugar
-   *1/2* cup (*110* grams) coconut oil, warmed just enough to liquefy
-   *1 1/2* cups full- or low-fat coconut milk (see Note)
-   *1* tablespoon (*15* ml) plain vinegar

Prepare
-------

-   Knife
-   Oven
-   Mixer

Steps
-----

1.  Heat oven to *350* degrees F
2.  Line the bottom of 9-inch round cake pan with a fitted round of parchment paper
3.  Coat the bottoms and sides with nonstick cooking spray
4.  Whisk together flour, baking soda, salt and granulated sugar in the bottom of a large mixing bowl
5.  Add coconut oil, coconut milk, and vinegar and whisk until batter is smooth
6.  Pour into prepared pan, bake for 25 to 30 minutes
7.  Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, cut around it with a knife

Add a pinch of salt, if you wish.

Euclidean distance
==================

Definition
----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\mathbf{pd}}$).

<br/>In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p1, p2,..., pn) and q = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

<br/> d(**p**, **q**) = d(**q**, **p**) = $\\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + ... + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}$ = $\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i - p\_i)^2}$.

<br/>The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

<br/>||**p**|| = $\\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2}$ = $\\sqrt{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}$,

<br/>where the last expression involves the dot product.

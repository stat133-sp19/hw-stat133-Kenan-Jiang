**Who is the strongest warrior? Curry? Durant? Everyone has their own answer. In the past 2016 season, warriors presented us with countless amazing moments. While the fans are cheering for their stars on the court, the data obtained from each game might give us some better insights on the performance of our favorite warriors.**

## Motivation
This project is aimed to analyze the perform of five warriors: **Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson**, and **Stephen Curry**. I want to study their strength of scoring in 2016 season. For instance, the position in which they often shoot, the accuracy of their shot, the type of shot they often take. In general, I want to understand their scoring pattern.

## Background
For each player, I obtained one dataset which contains his specific scoring information. These five datasets are conclusive enough and easy to understand for someone who even does not watch basketball. 

## Data
Each .csv file, in columns, contains same information in sequence for its corresponding players. The first column is the team the player is in, which is always Golden State Warriors. The second column is the date of the game. The third column is the season, which in this project, is always 2016. Then there are columns of **period**, **minutes_remaining**, and **second_remaining**. Information in these three columns will work together to provide the time when the player made the corresponding shot. Then we have a column named shot_made_flag, which indicates whether the shot is a goal or not. The action_type column documents the action the player performs to take the shot. The **shot_type** stores the type of the shot. The shot distance contains the distance from the basket measured in feet. The **opponent** column has the name of the team our play is playing against. The x, y columns works together to provide us with the coordinates of each shot. In general, these files give us well-rounded information on each shot one player made in 2016 season. 

## Analysis 
First, I need do de some data cleaning to these five .csv files. I added a new column called **name** in each of the data, storing the name of the player in it. Since the time of the shot is provided by three columns, it is not too obvious to obtain the information. I, again, added another column called **minute** to document the exactly minute of the shot after some calculation. Then I output the summary of these files into my output folder. Then I combined those five .csv files into one big .csv file using rbind, and stored this new file along with other .csv files in the data folder. Then I output a summary file in the output folder. Now we are all set to make some visualizations.

Now we want to see the position in which each player often shoots the basket. Firstly, I choose to use ggplot function to create a shot chart for each player, using the x, y column is the .csv file. To make it easier for our readers to identify where on the court those shots happened, I added a picture of basketball court as the background of our shot chart. Then we have a delicate chart for each player. We put these charts in one graph.
```{r, out.width="80%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(("../images/gsw-shot-charts.jpg"))
```
From the chart above, one would notice that Durant, Thompson, and Curry have make many attempts to shoot the basket in 2016 season. Compared to them, Iguodala and Green shot less. Comparing the distribution of the dots, we can see each player's preferable shooting location. Iguodala liked to shoot from the corner. Green preferred to shot from wing, top of the circle, and three second area. Durant, Thompson, and Curry did not seem to have a preferred location. They shoot anywhere on the court. 

Well, the accuracy is important to a basketball player. It might be hard to obtain the accuracy rate of each player's shot, so I produced these following tables to present how each player behaved in 2 pointers, 3 pointers, and total shots. I used the shots-data.csv created by combining the five individual files to make these table. Use the dplyr library, we can get summarize the dataset group by the name of the player.
```{r, out.width="80%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(("../images/players.jpg"))
```

```{r, message=F, warning=F, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```
##### 2PT Effective Shooting % by Players
```{r}
shots_data <- read.csv("../data/shots-data.csv")
two_pt <- summarise(group_by(shots_data, name), total = length(which(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal")), made = length(which(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"&shot_made_flag == "shot_yes")), perc_made = (made/total))
two_pt <- arrange(two_pt, desc(perc_made))
two_pt
```
From the table above, one can see that in 2016 season, Andre Iguodala had the highest accuracy when it comes to shooting 2-pointers. Only based on these numbers, surprisingly, Durant had both a larger total shot and made shot than Curry. This might suggest Durant did better in 2-pointers than Curry did.

##### 3PT Effective Shooting % by Players
```{r}
three_pt <- summarise(group_by(shots_data, name), total = length(which(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal")), made = length(which(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal"&shot_made_flag == "shot_yes")), perc_made = (made/total))
three_pt <- arrange(three_pt, desc(perc_made))
three_pt
```
From this 3 pt table above, one can see that Klay Thompson had the highest accuracy rate. Notably, Curry attempted to shoot lots of 3 points, and he mode the most 3 points among the five players. Curry had a higher accuracy than Durant when it comes to comparing three points. 

#####  Effective Shooting % by Players
```{r} 
total_pt <- summarise(group_by(shots_data, name), total = length(shot_type), made = length(which(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes")), perc_made = (made/total))
total_pt <- arrange(total_pt, desc(perc_made))
total_pt
```
The table above shows that, in general, Durant had the highest shooting accuracy in 2016 season. Surprisingly, Curry's shooting accuracy only ranked the fourth among the accuracy of the five players. How did this happen? Let's take a deep thought.

##Discussion
Just now, the Effective Shooting % by Players table throws us an interesting problem: *Why did Curry have such low accuracy?* Personally, I think the reason might be related to the business side of NBA games. People pays to watch their favorite players to play on court. Curry, a huge star, must have lots of fans coming to the game for him. Then, to please those fans, Curry might be assigned to have more time on the court and have more time to control the ball. This would lead to making some risky shots during the game. Durant, Iguodala, Curry and others are all great players, but when Curry has to make some unnecessary shots, his accuracy would get lower for sure. 

##Conclusion 
In this project, I visuilazed the the shooting location of five GSW, and preceived the shooting accurancy of each player. Due to the different position they play, each players have different shooting pattern. **It is important to realize that all the players are important to the game. Working together, they keep on creating those breath-taking moments in NBA history.**

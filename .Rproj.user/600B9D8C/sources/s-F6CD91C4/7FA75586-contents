## Binomial

The package `"binomial"` is an implementation for binomial distribution

## Calulate the number of combinations

`bin_choose()` allows you to calulate the number of combinations, passin trials as n, success as k

```{r}
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)
```

By default, `bin_choose()` calculates the number of combinations of n trials and k success

## Calulate the probability

`bin_probability()` allows you to calulate the probability from known success, trials, prob

```{r}
bin_probability(success=2, trials=5, prob=0.5)
```

The example above calculates the probability of 2 success, 5 trials, and 0.5 prob

## Calulate all possible probability

The `bin_distribution()` function gives you a dataframe contains probability for all possible success:
```{r}
bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

## Calulate cumulative probability

The `bin_cumulative()` function gives you a dataframe contains probability and cumulative prob for all possible success:
```{r}
bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

## Plot of probability

You can use the function `plot()` to create a barplot with probability for each success if you passin a "bindis" object:

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
library(ggplot2)
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis1)
```

You can use the function `plot()` to create a line plot with cumulative probability if you passin a "bincum" object:

```{r}
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis2)
```

## Print variable

You print the variable out by calling the "binvar" or a "summary.binvar" object:

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
bin1
```
Use `summary()` to get the summary of a "binvar" object""
```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1
```

## Functions of measures

You can get the mean, variance, mode, skewness, kurtosis of the distribution:

```{r}
bin_mean(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```

```{r}
bin_variance(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```

```{r}
bin_mode(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```

```{r}
bin_skewness(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```

```{r}
bin_kurtosis(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```
